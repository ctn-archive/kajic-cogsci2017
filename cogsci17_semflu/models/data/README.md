This directory contains model simulations. Every simulation run is stored in
a folder, and a trial of an experiment is a file in that folder.

The directory label is constructed to contain name of the association source
(fan, beagle, ngram) ad parameters used in the simulation. Running the same
script twice without changing parameters will append further simulation results
in that folder.
